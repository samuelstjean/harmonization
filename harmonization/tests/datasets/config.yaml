# Paths can be relative or absolute, but the root needs to already be created
# Any subfolder (i.e. each subject has its own folder) will be created accordingly

# If globbing is allowed, a star expression needs to be a quoted string or it crashes the reader

# Each folder contains one subject, this is what is used by the HCP and the BIDS format
