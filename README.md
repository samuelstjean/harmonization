## Harmonization of diffusion MRI datasets with adaptive dictionary learning

~~~
Looks like the manuscript is now accepted, but I haven't had the time to go through everything for a cleanup. 
If it's taking too long just bug me about it so that I remember that people are waiting on it.

Coming soon : Actual instructions and example, along with the new configurations file format (one file which conatains all parameters) I am using now.

In the meantime, you can check out the [published version](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25117)

The manuscript detailing the original harmonization challenge which lead to this algorithm is also available from the publisher [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919300837).
